            And the basic idea with this Web site is that someone can enter in some text on the home page hit a
            count button and then our Gengel Web site is going to analyze that text count it word by word and say
            hey the word showed up 13 times in the Word and showed up eight times.

            It's going to count them and show them from the most frequently used all the way down to the least.

            So the basic idea behind this project is I want you to know how Django works you're going to see the
            structure of what a Django project looks like.
